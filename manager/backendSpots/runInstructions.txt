Run server
1. In the backendSpots directory type the following script: npm run server
2. In the console you should see the following messages: "Server is running on port 5000" followed by "MongoDB Connected!" 
3. For this demo I set the server to port 5000 but you can change it in the port variable in server.js line 22.

Test API Server Get Request
1. Make sure your server is still running in the console or else this will not work.
