Directions for working on the code.
1. Download node.js
2. Install the create-react-app functionality using node.js.
3. Download all dependencies that you need using npm install ______.
So far we need react, react-bootstrap, react-router-dom, react-bootstrap-router.
4. Use the create-react-app command and cd into the directory created.
5. If you want to use/see what we have done so far:
  a. Download code as a zip file from SA-Branch (Manager by Swetha) or EL-Branch (Elevator by Nick)
    1. cd into project folder
    2. Install all the dependencies using npm install ____. They are listed above.
    3. npm start
  b. Copy parts of code like App.js, Navbar.js, etc. (If you only want to use some components) Follow above instructions.
 6. Install mongodb. I think we will use MongoDB's cloud based Atlas. If anyone has other ideas let me know ASAP.

    I'm creating accounts for everyone. The password is SmartPark2020.
    The username is your firstname2020. (ex. nick2020)
    Once you install mongoDB Compass, put your credentials in for username and password below.
    mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@smartpark-necgp.mongodb.net/test
    ex mongodb+srv://param2020:SmartPark2020@smartpark-necgp.mongodb.net/test
    If you have a problem with this message me.
 7. Install express: Haven't started this yet myself. You can use express generator.
 npm install express --save
 npm install -g express-generator
Alternate:
Use yarn instead of npm for react. If using mac, you can first install homebrew and then install yarn. If using windows, you can directly install yarn.
