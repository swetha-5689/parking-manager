Using Learn the MERN stack YouTube Video
npm init //this command sets up the package.json file
npm i express body-parser mongoose concurrently //this line installs express, mongoose for working with 
                                                // mongoDB and concurrently for running client/server same time
npm i -D nodemon

we add scripts to the "scripts" section of package.json
    "scripts": {
    "start": "server.js",
    "server": "nodemon server.js"
This lets us update without having to constantly reload

Add body-parser syntax to server.js

Next, we create a mongoDB cluster for free at mLab

The mongo URI
mongodb+srv://chuck:<password>@mernshopping-dulm0.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Next setup the mongoDB schema, schemas map to Mongo DB and define the shape of the documents within collection

Then we create a folder routes, and a subfolder api. Inside there a file items.js
This serves as an api for to handle the get and put requests.

POSTMAN for testing the puts and gets and deletes. Pretty kewl
