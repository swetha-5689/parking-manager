1. To start off, make sure you have nodemon installed on your computer. Nodemon helps run the server dynamically while you make changes to any source code. This basically replaces using "node" :)
2. Make sure you cd into the "backend" directory
3. Next, type "nodemon server" into the terminal and you should get this message back: "Server is runner on port: 6000"
"MongoDB database connection established successfully"
4. Open up MongoDB Compass or Atlas on your computer
5. Type in this URI to connect to the database: mongodb+srv://brian2020:SmartPark2020@smartpark-necgp.mongodb.net/SmartPark?retryWrites=true&w=majority
6. Now that we know that the database is connected and the server is up, its time to test making post and get requests!
7. Make sure you have Postman or Insomnia downloaded on your computer. Those programs test REST api network connections
8. Once you have either program open, find a place where it tells you to input a url and put this in: "http://localhost:6000/account
9. Make sure you use this as a GET request and then click send
10. You should see all the accounts created in the database! You'll also see an unique id associated with each of them
11. Now let's try and input a new user in there. Change the url by adding /add at the end of account
12. Input a new user by following this json format:
{
"username": "texthere",
"email": "texthere",
"firstname": "texthere",
"lastname": "texthere",
"password": "texthere",
}
13. After you type that, press send and you should get a message saying: "Account Created!"
14. You can take a look at the models and routes to see other things you can input and receive from the database!
